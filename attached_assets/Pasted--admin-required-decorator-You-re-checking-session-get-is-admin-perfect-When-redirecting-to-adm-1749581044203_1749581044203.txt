@admin_required decorator

You’re checking session.get('is_admin')—perfect.

When redirecting to admin_login, consider passing next with url_for('manage_boxes', _external=False) to avoid open-redirect risks (or sanitize next).

Login / Logout

After successful login you pop next = request.args.get('next'), then redirect. Make sure next is relative (to avoid redirecting off-site).

Logout clears both is_admin and admin_username, which is exactly what you want.

ORM vs. Raw SQL Consistency

Your edit route uses Box.query.get_or_404 and HardwareType.query, so I’m assuming you’ve switched to SQLAlchemy models. Just verify your model fields match:

python
Copier
class Box(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    box_id = db.Column(db.String, unique=True)
    hardware_type_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('hardware_types.id'))
    lot_number_id   = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('lot_numbers.id'))
    box_number      = db.Column(db.String)
    barcode         = db.Column(db.String, unique=True)
    initial_quantity   = db.Column(db.Integer)
    remaining_quantity = db.Column(db.Integer)
    # …
And that your lookup models use .name (or .number) consistently in both code and templates.

generate_box_id helper

You’re calling generate_box_id(...) after the update—just ensure that function is defined (same logic as your f-string in add_box) and accessible here.

Form Data vs. Model Attributes

In your template you reference lot.name, but in your original schema the column was called number (lot_numbers.number). If you renamed it to .name, be consistent; otherwise use lot.number in the template.

Validation Edge Cases

You’ve covered most quantity checks; just double-check that zero is allowed where you want it (you’ve set min="0" and prevent negatives).

On barcode change, you correctly check new_barcode != box.barcode before querying for duplicates—good.

UI Consistency

In manage_boxes.html you added a “Current Qty” column but in the code you still pull box.remaining_quantity. Since you’ve renamed it remaining_quantity in the model, everything lines up.

Your status color logic (<10 → warning, 0 → danger) is a nice touch.

Protecting all management routes

You decorated /manage_boxes, /edit_box, and /delete_box—don’t forget if you have any AJAX or API endpoints for inline editing, they also need @admin_required.

CSRF Tokens

If you ever layer in Flask-WTF or another CSRF solution later, wrap your POST forms with {{ csrf_token() }}. For now, the plain forms work, but bear in mind for production.
