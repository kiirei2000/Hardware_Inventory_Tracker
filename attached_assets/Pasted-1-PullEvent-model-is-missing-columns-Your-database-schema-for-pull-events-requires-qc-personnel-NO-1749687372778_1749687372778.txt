1. PullEvent model is missing columns
Your database schema for pull_events requires qc_personnel (NOT NULL) and signature, but your SQLAlchemy model only declares:

python
Copier
    mo = db.Column(db.String(50))
    operator = db.Column(db.String(50))
    qc_operator = db.Column(db.String(50))
    timestamp = db.Column(db.DateTime, …)
Fix: add these two columns to your model:

python
Copier
    qc_personnel = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    signature    = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=True)
After that, run a migration (or drop&recreate) so the ORM and actual schema match.

2. log_event never sets qc_personnel or signature
In your improved log_event handler you collect:

python
Copier
    qc_operator = request.form['qc_operator']
    # but no request.form.get('qc_personnel') or signature
Fix:

Read them from the form:

python
Copier
qc_personnel = request.form.get('qc_personnel', '').strip()
signature    = request.form.get('signature', '').strip()
Validate them alongside the other fields.

Assign them to the new columns on pull_event before db.session.add():

python
Copier
pull_event.qc_personnel = qc_personnel
pull_event.signature    = signature
3. log_pull mixes up the operator fields
Your working log_pull endpoint does:

python
Copier
pull_event.operator    = qc_personnel
pull_event.qc_operator = signature
# but never sets pull_event.qc_personnel or pull_event.signature
That means your “QC Personnel” is being stored in the wrong column, and the required qc_personnel is still empty.

Fix:

If you intend operator to be the person who pulled, and qc_personnel the checker, then map accordingly:

python
Copier
pull_event.operator     = request.form['operator']      # who did the pull
pull_event.qc_personnel = request.form['qc_personnel']  # QC checker
pull_event.signature    = request.form['signature']
Drop the qc_operator column altogether if it isn’t needed, or rename it if it really meant “QC signature.”

4. Column naming consistency
You currently have three variations in your code/schema:

Concept	Schema column	Model attribute	Form field
Who pulled	—	operator	operator
QC checker	qc_personnel	missing	qc_personnel
Signature	signature	missing	signature
QC operator?	—	qc_operator	qc_operator

Decide on exactly two roles—“operator” and “QC personnel”—plus the optional signature, then:

Update your DB schema to match (or generate a migration).

Update your SQLAlchemy model to define exactly those three columns.

Update both log_pull and log_event to read & assign those fields.

Remove any leftover qc_operator references if you don’t need them.

5. Final sanity check
After those fixes, walk through:

Form → server: make sure every <input name="…"> has a matching request.form.get('…').

Server → model: every required db.Column(nullable=False) is assigned before session.add().

Commit: check your logs (or interactive shell) to ensure no NOT NULL constraint errors.

With those aligned, your “important action” will fire properly, your events will get committed, and you’ll see full audit data for each pull or return.
