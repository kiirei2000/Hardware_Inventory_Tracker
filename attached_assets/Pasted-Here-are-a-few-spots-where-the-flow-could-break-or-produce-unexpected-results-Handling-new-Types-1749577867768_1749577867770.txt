Here are a few spots where the flow could break or produce unexpected results:

Handling “new” Types/Lots

Your form lets users type in a new hardware type (and lot) but the POST handler never inserts those into hardware_types or lot_numbers. You’ll end up with dropdowns that don’t match your master tables.

Fix: On POST, check if the text‐inputs for “new type” / “new lot” are non‐empty, insert them into their lookup tables, then use those IDs (or names) when making the box.

Foreign‐Key Enforcement vs Plain TEXT

In boxes, you store hardware_type TEXT and lot_number TEXT rather than FK IDs. That makes it easy to get typos or orphaned entries if someone manually edits the DB.

Fix: Store hardware_type_id INTEGER REFERENCES hardware_types(id) and likewise for lot_number_id; JOIN back for display.

Dropdown Population & Template Mismatch

In add_box, you do

python
Copier
types = db.execute("SELECT DISTINCT name FROM hardware_types").fetchall()
but your template expects <option value="{{ type.id }}">{{ type.name }}</option> (presumably). As written, types is a list of 1-tuples like ("Widget",) unless you use row_factory.

Fix: SELECT id, name, or unpack your tuples in the template.

Box ID Collisions & Special Characters

You generate box_id = f"{hardware_type}|{lot_number}|{box_number}". If any of those strings contain “|” or spaces, you could end up with ambiguous IDs (e.g. “A|B|C” vs “A|B|C”).

Fix: Either sanitize (strip/escape) inputs or use a more robust scheme (e.g. zero‐padded numbers or UUID).

Quantity Validation

You check only if remaining_quantity >= quantity_pulled, which is good. But there’s no lower‐bound check on negative pulls or zero.

Fix: Disallow quantity_pulled <= 0, and maybe enforce quantity_pulled <= original_quantity.

Timestamp Timezone & Consistency

Using datetime.now() will use server local time (UTC? whatever). Meanwhile your SQLite CURRENT_TIMESTAMP is always UTC. This mismatch can confuse your logs.

Fix: Pick one (e.g. datetime.utcnow()) or always rely on the DB’s default timestamp, passing no timestamp in the INSERT.

Scanner Integration Edge Cases

If the camera fails or the QR code is unreadable, you never call .stop() or hide the container, so the UI stays stuck.

Fix: Add error callbacks to .start() to .stop() on failure or a manual “Cancel” button.

Log-Pull Form Needs Hardware Type & Lot Inputs

In your JS you auto-fill input[name="hardware_type"], but your pull form HTML only shows barcode, quantity, QC name and signature. If you’re relying on hardware_type elsewhere, you’ll need hidden fields or to re-query on the server.

Lack of CSRF Protection

I don’t see any Flask-WTF or CSRF token in your forms. In production you’ll want at least a simple {{ csrf_token() }} pattern or a header check.

UX: Immediate Redirect on Error

When you flash “Barcode not found!” you redirect back to the blank form. The user loses all their other field entries.

Fix: Render the same template with request.form pre-filled so they only have to fix the barcode.
